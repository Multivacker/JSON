Values in a JSON object can be another JSON object.

Example
myObj = {
    "name":"John",
    "age":30,
    "cars": {
        "car1":"Ford",
        "car2":"BMW",
        "car3":"Fiat"
    }
 }
You can access nested JSON objects by using the dot notation or bracket notation:

Example
x = myObj.cars.car2;
//or:
x = myObj.cars["car2"];
