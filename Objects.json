JSON Objects
Object Syntax
Example
{ "name":"Nahuel", "age":39, "car":null }

JSON objects are surrounded by curly braces {}.

JSON objects are written in key/value pairs.

Keys must be strings, and values must be a valid JSON data type (string, number, object, array, boolean or null).

Keys and values are separated by a colon.

Each key/value pair is separated by a comma.
