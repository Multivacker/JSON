PHP Database
PHP is a server side programming language, and should be used for operations that can only be performed by a server, like accessing a database.

Imagine you have a database on the server, containing customers, products, and suppliers.

You want to make a request to the server where you ask for the first 10 records in the "customers" table:

Example
Use JSON.stringify() to convert the JavaScript object into JSON:

obj = { "table":"customers", "limit":10 };
dbParam = JSON.stringify(obj);
xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = this.responseText;
    }
};
xmlhttp.open("GET", "json_demo_db.php?x=" + dbParam, true);
xmlhttp.send();
Example explained:
Define an object containing a table property and a limit property.
Convert the object into a JSON string.
Send a request to the PHP file, with the JSON string as a parameter.
Wait until the request returns with the result (as JSON)
Display the result received from the PHP file.
