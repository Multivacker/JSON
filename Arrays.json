JSON Arrays
Arrays as JSON Objects
Example
[ "Ford", "BMW", "Fiat" ]
Arrays in JSON are almost the same as arrays in JavaScript.

In JSON, array values must be of type string, number, object, array, boolean or null.

In JavaScript, array values can be all of the above, plus any other valid JavaScript expression, including functions, dates, and undefined.

Arrays in JSON Objects
Arrays can be values of an object property:

Example
{
"name":"Nahuel",
"age":39,
"cars":[ "Ford", "BMW", "Fiat" ]
}
