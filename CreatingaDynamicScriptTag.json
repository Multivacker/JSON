Creating a Dynamic Script Tag
The example above will execute the "myFunc" function when the page is loading, based on where you put the script tag, which is not very satisfying.

The script tag should only be created when needed:

Example
Create and insert the <script> tag when a button is clicked:

function clickButton() {
    var s = document.createElement("script");
    s.src = "demo_jsonp.php";
    document.body.appendChild(s);
}
