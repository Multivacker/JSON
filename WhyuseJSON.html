  Why use JSON?
Since the JSON format is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

JavaScript has a built in function to convert a string, written in JSON format, into native JavaScript objects:

JSON.parse()

So, if you receive data from a server, in JSON format, you can use it like any other JavaScript object.
