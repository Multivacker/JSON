JSON PHP
A common use of JSON is to read data from a web server, and display the data in a web page.

This chapter will teach you how to exchange JSON data between the client and a PHP server.

The PHP File
PHP has some built-in functions to handle JSON.

Objects in PHP can be converted into JSON by using the PHP function json_encode():

PHP file
<?php
$myObj->name = "John";
$myObj->age = 30;
$myObj->city = "New York";

$myJSON = json_encode($myObj);

echo $myJSON;
?>
