JSON.parse()
A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server.

When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string.

Parse the data with JSON.parse(), and the data becomes a JavaScript object.

Example - Parsing JSON
Imagine we received this text from a web server:

'{ "name":"Nahuel", "age":39, "city":"Buenos Aires"}'
Use the JavaScript function JSON.parse() to convert text into a JavaScript object:

var obj = JSON.parse('{ "name":"John", "age":30, "city":"New York"}');
Make sure the text is written in JSON format, or else you will get a syntax error.

Use the JavaScript object in your page:

Example
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = obj.name + ", " + obj.age;
</script>
